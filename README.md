This is an example of a Node consumer using Pact to create a consumer driven contract, and sharing it via [Pactflow](https://pactflow.io).

It is using a public tenant on Pactflow, which you can access [here](https://test.pact.dius.com.au) using the credentials `dXfltyFMgNOFZAxr8io9wJ37iUpY42M`/`O5AIZWxelWbLvqMd8PkAVycBJh2Psyg1`. The latest version of the Example Consumer/Example Provider pact is published [here](https://test.pact.dius.com.au/pacts/provider/pactflow-example-provider/consumer/pactflow-example-consumer/latest).

The project uses a Makefile to simulate a very simple build pipeline with two stages - test and deploy.

* Test
  * Run tests (including the pact tests that generate the contract)
  * Publish pacts, tagging the consumer version with the name of the current branch
  * Check if we are safe to deploy to prod (ie. has the pact content been successfully verified)
* Deploy (only from master)
  * Deploy app (just pretend for the purposes of this example!)
  * Tag the deployed consumer version as 'prod'
